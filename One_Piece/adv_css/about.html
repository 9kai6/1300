            <h1 class="heading_style">About Roger</h1>
            <p>Gol D. Roger is one of the legendary characters in One Piece. He is considered the greatest pirate in history and the first owner of the title "One Piece". He is an important figure in the entire One Piece story. Although he has passed away, his deeds and influence run through the entire story.</p>

            <h2 class="heading_style">Posthumous Effects</h2>
            <p>Roger's death did not end his legend, but became the starting point of the "Pirate Age". After he announced his death, a large number of pirates began to emerge from all corners of the world, all of whom were adventuring in search of ONE PIECE. This phenomenon became the fundamental driving force behind all the pirate adventures in the story of "One Piece".</p>

            <h3 class="heading_style">"The Strongest Man in the World"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Whitebeard is the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates. The pirate group he led had a huge force and was one of the most powerful pirate groups in the world at that time. The members of the Whitebeard Pirates were loyal to him, and Whitebeard was a respectable father figure in their hearts. Although Whitebeard was a pirate, he adhered to his principles and protected the people and friends he cherished.</li>
                <li>Tremor-Tremor Fruit: Whitebeard ate the Tremor-Tremor Fruit, a very powerful nature-type Devil Fruit that can control vibrations and shock waves, allowing him to create huge vibrations that can destroy anything and even cause earthquakes. Whitebeard's vibration ability is extremely powerful, and he can use this ability to cause large-scale destruction, even causing tsunamis or destroying entire islands.</li>
                <li>Whitebeard is known as the "strongest man in the world", and this title is not groundless. Even in his old age, he is still the most powerful being on the sea, able to fight against "Pirate King" Roger, and repeatedly defeated the powerful enemies of the World Government with his own strength. Even in the face of a joint attack by the World Government and the Navy, Whitebeard was still fearless and was one of the most threatening figures at the time.</li>
                <li>Relationship with Roger: Whitebeard once fought against the Pirate King Roger, and there was a deep mutual respect between the two. Although they were rivals, there was no hatred between them. Whitebeard once publicly stated that Roger was the only man who could fight him. The relationship between the two deeply influenced the subsequent pirate era.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="heading_style">Whitebeard and Roger's Legacy</h3>
            <p>Legacy and Influence:
                Although Roger and Whitebeard represent two different philosophies (Roger pursues the freedom of a unified world, while Whitebeard focuses on his "family"), their existence has profoundly influenced the entire world. Roger's legacy is "ONE PIECE" and revealing the truth of the world, while Whitebeard defended the freedom and courage of pirates with his life, and finally made his life one of the leaders of the "Pirate Age".</p>
