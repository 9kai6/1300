        <h3 class="heading_style">Meet the Characters</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>In the film, Daji is a concubine of the Shang Dynasty and is considered one of the female characters who brought disaster to the country and the people. In the film, Daji is portrayed as a very charming and complex female character. Her relationship with King Zhou of Shang and her evil aura add a mysterious touch to the film. Daji's character is not simply a villain. Her complexity makes the audience feel both hostile and sympathetic towards her.</li>
            <li>King Zhou was the last monarch of the Shang Dynasty, known for his tyranny and debauchery. In the movie, King Zhou not only showed a tyrannical ruling style, but also showed an extreme desire and fear for power. He was a very contradictory character, with strong political and military talents on the one hand, and indulged in pleasure on the other. Chen Kun's interpretation added a lot of layers to King Zhou, making this character look both evil and tragic.</li>
            <li>Yin Jiao is a prince of the Shang Dynasty, a skilled warrior, but a tragic character. In the story, Yin Jiao eventually embarks on a path of rebellion under the guidance of his father, King Zhou, and becomes one of the main enemies of the Zhou uprising. Despite his outstanding talents and courage, he suffers a tragic fate in the Conferred Gods War and eventually dies in battle.</li>
            <li>Ji Fa is one of the core characters in The Investiture of the Gods. He is the son of the legendary King Wen of Zhou and later the founder of the Zhou Dynasty - King Wu of Zhou. He is a hero in the story, with great wisdom and leadership skills, and is also the representative of justice in the play.</li>
         </ul>
