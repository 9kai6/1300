            <h3 class="heading_style">The ability of rubber fruit</h3>

            <p>Body Elasticity: Luffy's entire body has become rubber, and can stretch, deform, elongate, and even rebound like a spring. For example, Luffy can stretch his arms to strike enemies at a distance, or bounce out of the enemy's attack range.</p>

            <img class="movie_post" src="images/haizeixiangkesi.jpeg" alt="Tianpeng and Zizhuer">

            <p>Shanks is one of the legendary characters in "One Piece" and has a very high status and influence. He is not only Luffy's enlightenment mentor, but also occupies an important position in the pirate world. As one of the Four Emperors, Shanks' leadership, wisdom and powerful strength make him one of the representative figures in the pirate world. Although he is not based on violence, his deterrent power and strength should not be underestimated.</p>
